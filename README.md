User Stories
User stories are actions that the user should be able to perform in your app.

First, focus and identify functionality that is required for your MVP (Minimum Viable Product) that conforms to all the project requirements and expectations. Make sure your technical challenges are part of your MVP.

You should also identify optional / nice-to-have functionalities that would be done as stretch goals during MU Week 8 and 9. Remember, technical challenges should not be optional features, they must be code complete before the end of Week 8!
